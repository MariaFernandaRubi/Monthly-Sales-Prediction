# 📊 Monthly-Sales-Prediction
Monthly Sales Prediction with Python (Linear Regression)

## 📖 Objective
The goal of this project is to **predict product sales over time** using a **linear regression model**.  
By analyzing historical sales data, the project seeks to identify trends, forecast future demand, and support decision-making in inventory and sales strategy.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** For analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- **pandas:** For structuring, cleaning, and manipulating tabular data.
- **matplotlib:** For building basic plots (line, bar, scatter).
- **seaborn:** For statistical and professional data visualizations.
- **scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the linear regression model.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Simulated monthly sales data for 2024-2025.  
- **Structure:** Month (2024-01 to 2025-07) monthly Sales (Units sold)

## 🔎 Process
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Sales trends over time.  
   - Correlation between units sold and total sales.  

2. **Modeling**  
   - Built a **Linear Regression model** using scikit-learn.  
   - Trained the model to predict sales based on historical data.  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Sales trends plotted with matplotlib and seaborn.  
   - Scatter plots with regression lines to show model fit.  

## 📈 Results 
- Predicted demand trends useful for **inventory and production planning**.
